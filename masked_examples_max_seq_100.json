After 2 rounds he will automatically close the gate. The first time the player approaches the gate from the interior of the village a conversation between the gatekeeper (OutcastMan045) and Hesther (OutcastWom043) will ensue as Hendar (OutcastMan046) runs for the gate with a Rakghoul in pursuit. The player can offer to help Hendar and the gatekeeper will open the gate, or he can simply sit and watch as hendar is killed (4 rounds after Hendar reaches the gate if the player does not intervene, or instantly if the player refuses to open the gate). If the player saves Hendar, he and Hesther thank the player and wander off. If Hendar dies, Hesther wanders off and reviles the player. Exit points in conversation: Exit stream 1: If the player approaches the guard for the first time and is outside the gates this will mark the guard as talked to and open the gates then close them after 2 rounds. Exit stream 2: Player has promised to save Hendar, guard opens gate. Player has 4 rounds to go through the gate or Rakghoul kills Hendar then runs off. Exit stream 3: If player talks to guard while Hendar is being attacked and chooses to let him die. Depending on the path the player can get a dark side hit.

(Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: I do love you, Bastila. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: I love you, Bastila, but after everything that's happened...

(Animation: [{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: No. I'm sorry, Bastila, but I don't love you. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: You are brave... and foolish. The dark side has wholly consumed me, and you will suffer for failing to see that! (Animation: [{'Bastila': 'Taunt'}], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: You won't, Bastila. I know you still serve the light side. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: You're right. I suppose I can't trust you, after all. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: A wise decision. You cannot trust me, and you cannot bring yourself to execute me. I see now there is only one way this can end. The time for words is done! Defend yourself! (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: You're right. Don't worry, you won't feel a thing. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: Do it. Quickly... (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: [Failure] There is nothing in my heart but the blackness of the dark side! I am sick of your preaching, Revan! (Animation: [{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}], Comment: nan)\nBastila: I ask you for an honorable death, but you are too weak to even grant me that! No more words! This must end with blood! (Animation: [{'Bastila': 'Talk_Forceful'}], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: [Persuade] Look into your heart, Bastila, and you will find the light. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: [Success] I... I know a flicker of the light still burns within me. Malak felt it too. He knew it could only be extinguished if I killed you. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: But what good is a single flicker of light against the sea of darkness I am drowning in? I can never atone for my betrayal. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: I was redeemed, Bastila. You can be, too. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: You were a special case. The Council had no other choice. They needed you alive so they could discover the location of the Star Forge. It was an act of desperation. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: It was my responsibility to watch over you, to make sure you did not slip back into your evil ways. I was supposed to protect you from the dark side. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: You did protect me, Bastila. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: But at what cost? In protecting you, I fell to the dark side myself. Is that the price of a Jedi's redemption? Must another of the Order fall to save me? (Animation: [{'Bastila': 'Talk_Pleading'}], Comment: nan)\nBastila: I cannot allow that to happen. Please, this is too painful. Strike me down. End this now, quickly. There is no other way. (Animation: [{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: You can't protect someone from the dark side. Each individual must choose their own path. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: I... I suppose you are right. Yet the path I have chosen is that of the dark side. I don't see any way I could atone for what I have done. I deserve to die. (Animation: [{'Bastila': 'Talk_Sad'}], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: You did more than protect me, Bastila. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nBastila: <MASK>\nBastila: Please... this is too painful. End it now, quickly. There is no other way.

(Animation: [], Comment: nan)\noutcastshaleena: Rukil's the oldest man in the village. The kids call him Rukil Wrinkle-Skin, but he's a kind man.

(Animation: [], Comment: nan)\noutcastshaleena: Oh... okay. Well, if you ever need anything, or if you just feel like talking, come back and see me.

(Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Have any other up-worlders come through here recently? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\noutcastshaleena: There were quite a few people from the surface marching through the village, but none of them bothered to talk to me.

I guess it's easier for me, since I've never known anything different. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\noutcastshaleena: Some of the people have given up all hope; they've become bitter and depressed. But most of us are good people... despite what our ancestors may have done. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\noutcastshaleena: Gendar could probably tell you more. Or maybe Rukil. You could talk to them if you want. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: I don't have time for this. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\noutcastshaleena: Of course... I'm sorry. You're probably here for something important, right? You probably want to speak to Gendar. He's the leader of our village. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\noutcastshaleena: But if you... if you have time later, maybe you could come back and speak to me again. I don't get much chance to talk with people from the surface. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: It's nothing special. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\noutcastshaleena: Not to you, I suppose. But you're probably used to its beauty by now.

(Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: A very pertinent point, prosecutor. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: It is now the defense's turn to cross-examine the witness. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: I have no additional questions. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Very well. Would you like to use this opportunity to poll the judges? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Yes. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: I think that Sunry, perhaps, could have been the culprit. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Jhosa: I think that Sunry was perfectly capable of committing this crime. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Naleshekan: It seems to me that the evidence is weighted against Sunry. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Kota: Despite his honorable past, Sunry would seem to have done something deplorable. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Duula: Sunry is obviously guilty of killing the Sith woman. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Since the defense has no further questions, we will call out the second witness: the Rodian Gluupor. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: The prosecution may question the witness. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nSith Diplomat: Gluupor the Rodian, you were staying in the hotel the night of the murder and saw Sunry leaving Elassa's room didn't you? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Yes, Gluupor see Sunry running down hallway, and when Gluupor look in room, Sith woman dead on floor. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nSith Diplomat: This is clear then: that Sunry left the room with the Sith Elassa already dead behind him. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Perhaps, Sith, perhaps. It is the turn of the defense to question the witness now. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Did you see Sunry kill Elassa? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Gluupor... Gluupor not see Sunry really hurt Sith... But Gluupor did see Sunry leaving room with dead Sith in it! (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: But... Gluupor not see him really kill Sith... (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: An important distinction Arbiter. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Do you wish to ask the witness anything else? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Isn't the medal at the crime scene too obvious a clue? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Gluupor not know. Why anyone leave things in someone else's room? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Gluupor just think these things happen. It is just... odd... (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Kota: <MASK>\nPlayer: Do you really think a cripple could have hurt Elassa? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Sunry seems like strong man, but he is hurt, too. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Gluupor not think that man like that would stand up to a Sith. Not at all. But Sunry still run fast after. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Duula: We know full well the extend of Sunry's injuries, Arbiter! (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: But the fact still remains. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Did you plant the medal on Elassa? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Gluupor... Gluupor... (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nSith Diplomat: Don't do it, Gluupor... (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: The prosecution will be silent! (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Naleshekan: What is it you wish to say Gluupor? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Gluupor... Gluupor paid by Sith to plant that medal. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nSith Diplomat: Lies! Slander! I object! (Animation: [{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}], Comment: nan)\nJudge Naleshekan: You are certain of this Gluupor? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nGluupor: Gluupor certain... (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: This new evidence puts the entire case in a new light. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Duula: Perhaps I was wrong, after all, in my thoughts about Sunry. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Duula: I cannot tell yet if Sunry killed Elassa, but I am confident it will be proven. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Kota: I do not believe Sunry, as a well-standing Republic citizen, could have committed this crime. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Kota: I just do not have enough information to judge this case yet. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Naleshekan: Sunry did not have the capacity to commit these murders... I think. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Naleshekan: I cannot make my decision on what I have yet seen. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Jhosa: Sunry perhaps was not the killer. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Jhosa: I am unsure as yet as to whether Sunry was the actual murderer. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: I think that Sunry could not have committed this crime. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: I do not have enough information to make an informed decision. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: No. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Did you actually see the murder happen? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nFirith Me: You mean actually see him kill her with my own eyes? Well... no... But I don't think there could have been anyone else there. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Your point is well-taken Arbiter. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Do you have additional questions? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Was the medal left at the crime scene not a little too obvious? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nFirith Me: I think it may have been. I mean, you'd have to pretty stupid to leave something that important lying around, wouldn't you? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Jhosa: This argument has merit. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: How could Sunry have harmed her if he was a cripple? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nFirith Me: Well he was moving pretty fast running away... but yeah, I mean, how could he kill a Sith warrior in combat? I don't know for sure... (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Do not think less of Sunry because of his handicap. He is fully capable. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Duula: Can't you see that the man can hardly walk, let alone fight Elassa? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: That is enough for now. We will deliberate on this later in private. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Elassa is a Dark Jedi, isn't she? (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nFirith Me: Yes, from what I could tell. She carried a lightsaber around under that cloak of hers. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nSith Diplomat: Objection! That doesn't prove she was a Jedi! (Animation: [{'Sith Diplomat': 'Talk_Forceful'}], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: No, this piece of evidence is very important. It establishes the character of Elassa and perhaps her intent in dealing with Sunry. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Do not undermine the witness! (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nIgnus: The man I saw leaving - Sunry - probably left after I heard the blaster shot. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nSith Diplomat: The guilt of the accused is apparent even this early in the trial. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: I have reconsidered. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Honesty is an attribute essential to the position of Arbiter, as is impartiality. It would not be advised for you to abuse either of these. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Duula: Do not mock us, Jedi! (Animation: [{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Enough! This case will proceed on schedule. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: Sunry is guilty of the murder. I have this recording as proof. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: A recording? Let this new evidence be entered in the records. (Animation: [], Comment:  player approaches seljud1 and hands over recording)\nJudge Naleshekan: Ah... this new evidence is most convincing. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Kota: Yes. Yes it seems to be. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: This shortens the trial considerably. In light of this new evidence there is no need to proceed with the witnesses or cross-examinations. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: This court hereby finds Sunry guilty of the murder of the Sith Elassa. (Animation: [], Comment:  guilty with tape)\nJudge Shelkar: In accordance with Selkath law the proscribed punishment for murder is death. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: The verdict has been delivered and this trial is now over. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nMission: Well, that didn't go well. If I'm ever on trial remind me not to ask you for help. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nCand: This is why we Mandalorians don't have courts. We prefer to settle things with trial by combat. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: Remove the guilty party from this courtroom. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJolee: I... I'm sorry, Sunry. And Elora. There is nothing more we can do. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nElora: *sob* Sunry... No... (Animation: [{'Elora': 'Horror'}], Comment: nan)\nBastila: This is the will of the court, but it doesn't feel like justice to me. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nCarth: I... I don't believe this. Sunry should be remembered as a hero, not as a murderer. This isn't right. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: [Force Persuade] You will find Sunry innocent. (Animation: [{'Player': 'Persuade'}], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: [Failure] You are in no position to tell us how to judge our laws! (Animation: [{'Judge Shelkar': 'Talk_Forceful'}], Comment: nan)\nJudge Duula: We know of your Order, Jedi. We know that you have powers to manipulate the minds of lesser creatures. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Duula: Do not think that we Selkath, the pinnacle of evolution, can be swayed by such means! (Animation: [{'Judge Duula': 'Talk_Forceful'}], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: If you attempt such manipulations again, Sunry will be found guilty, and you will summarily be put to death! We do not tolerate intrusions upon the justice of our courts! (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: I will find Sunry innocent. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nJudge Shelkar: That remains to be seen. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)\nPlayer: I have no comments at this time. (Animation: [], Comment: nan)",
